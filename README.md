## Motivation 
Confidence in an online world
Our lives have been subjected to digital attacks more than ever before.

In recent times, during the lockdown period, a lot of citizens were victims of an SMS scam. 
The victim receives an SMS as below:

> "Dear customer, your xxx bank account will be suspended! Please Re KYC Verification Update click here link http://446bdf227fc4.ngrok.io/xxxbank".

Once a victim clicks on the link and logs in to the phishing website using internet banking credentials, the attacker generates OTP for 2FA or two factor authentication which is delivered to the victim's phone number. The victim then enters this OTP in the phishing site, which the attacker captures and Finally, the attacker gains access to the victim's account using the OTP and performs fraudulent transactions.

Use your creativity to design and develop a mobile app which can automatically scan through SMS texts and detect possible fraud and phishing attacks and suggest the user not to click on such a link. Additionally, the app can have a "Report This" option which submits the incident to Cyber Security Department (CERT-In) for further investigation. How will you detect false positives in reporting such incidents?

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
